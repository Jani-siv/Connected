## Background for a project
Most projects that I have done,
I haven't seen class dependency as problematic.
Now I've come more familiar with the subject, and now I want to correct this way of thinking.
I want to study architecture point of view how design and implement classes with minimal number of dependencies. 
Dependencies are not always bad and with object-oriented programming,
we need to create dependencies to interact with other objects.

## Planning
The current plan is to get an overall overview scope of the project. 
Because this project is related to my thesis work and I have only limited time,
I need to specify scope for this project.
